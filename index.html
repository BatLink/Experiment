            In this task, you play a "social" game. you need to choose one of 4 social agents
            (A, B, C or D) with the mouse.
            <br>
            <br>
            Selecting each agent will show his or her emotional response to you. Your task is to select the agent with
            the best (most positive) emotional.
            <br>
            <br>
            Notice that when you select an agent there are two emotional responses: One and then another. Both of these
            count towards the agent’s response to you (they have the same weight).
            <br>
            <br>
            It is not possible to know in advance what would be the agents’ emotional response to you. You will find
            this out during the game.
            <br>
            <br>
            You are completely free to switch from one agent to the other in whatever frequency you want.
            <br>
            <br>
            At the end of the game you will get money based on the positivity/negativity of the agent’s emotions as
            ranked by a previous panel. For example, lets say that an agent was recorded at a positivity/negativity
            level of 2.5 (on a scale of 0 to 5) this mean you will get 2.5 cents for each round you select the agent.
            <br>
            <br>
            You do not know the number of rounds in advance.
            <br>
            <br>
            Also, the computer does not change the order of the agents once the game starts or
            changes outcomes because of choices you made.
            <br>
            <br>
            Press space bar to start. Good luck!
